HTTPS Content Signatures

The HTTPS Content Signatures extension provides a means of specifying
the HTTPS Response Bodies a server is supposed to return for given
paths. Together with Certificate Transparency, the use of this extension
makes it possible for users of a website to be notified of changes to
security-critical parts of the website, even if those changes are only
served to a small number of users.

This extension consists of a set of (path, hash) pairs. The path of each
pair may be either an absolute path, such as "/index.js?arg=1%3F", in
which case it applies to all domain names using the certificate, or a
fully qualified URL, such as "https://example.com/index.js?arg=1%3F".
The hash of each pair is an algorithm identifier string, such as
"sha256", concatenated with a dash "-", concatenated with a lowercase
hexadecimal digest of the expected content located at the path. The only
valid algorithm is currently sha256.

This extension MAY be marked critical.
