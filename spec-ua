This is a draft of the specification.


A user agent supporting the HTTPS Content Signatures[1] extension MUST
NOT process any response to a request to a path included in this
extension and MUST show a un-circumventable security error instead if
any of the following happen:

(1) The hash does not match the response the user agent received.

(2) The user agent thinks the algorithm specified is not valid as
defined in [1].

(3) The user agent receives a response code other than 200 or 302.

(4) The user agent receives a response code of 302, and the hash of the
new location is not specified in this extension or it is not the same as
the hash of the old location.
