This is a draft of the specification.


A user agent supporting the HTTPS Content Signatures[1] extension MUST
NOT process any response to a request to a path included in this
extension and MUST show a un-circumventable security error instead if
any of the following happen:

(1) The hash does not match the response the user agent received.

(2) The user agent thinks the algorithm specified is not valid as
defined in [1].

(3) The user agent receives a response code other than 200 or 302.

The user agent MAY allow responses with response code 302 if the
resource the user agent is redirected to matches the hash. Otherwise, it
MUST block 302 responses as described above. In any case, a user agent
MUST block responses following 302 redirection if the response does not
match the hash for the original path (and also if it doesn't match the
hash for the new path).
