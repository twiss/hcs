HCS is meant to prevent, or detect, the following attacks against users
of a web application:

1. The server owner goes rogue and serves malicious code from the server
   (the ability to detect this is, of course, dependent on the ability
   to identify malicious code).

2. The server gets hacked and serves malicious code.

3. The reverse-proxy CDN, if any, gets hacked or goes rogue and serves
   malicious code.

4. Any of the above, but the server or CDN serves malicious code to *a
   single user* (who may or may not be paying attention).
